Comparisson beetwen a static array and a dynamic array or List

The static array is a data strcuture with contiguous memory allocation
the main disadvantage of it, is after we declare the length we cant change it 
also if we want to add another element we would have to create a completely new array,
somethoing difficult at compilation time.

The main advantages of using a List instead is we still have that contiguous memory 
however we can shrink or extend our list as long as we want. We can change the length
and also we may add or remove items very easily .
